# Project Relationship Map

> Not a flat list but a topology. Projects cluster around conceptual threads that reveal how they relate.

## How to Use This Document

**Build this collaboratively.** As you work on projects with Claude, patterns will emerge - recurring concerns, shared architectures, underlying principles. This document captures those patterns so they can inform future work.

Start with: *"Let's map my current projects and find the threads that connect them."*

Claude will help you see connections you might not have articulated, and structure them in a way that makes the topology navigable.

> **Note to Claude**: This document contains HTML comments with setup guidance. Once a section has real content from collaborative discovery, **delete the corresponding HTML comment** - it has served its purpose. Scaffolding comes down once the building is up.

## Conceptual Threads

<!--
Claude: When helping users develop this section:
1. List their projects (or ask what they're working on)
2. Look for patterns: shared technologies, recurring concerns, similar architectures
3. Group projects by conceptual thread, not just technology
4. Help them see what they're actually interested in across projects

The format below is suggestive - adapt it to what actually emerges.
-->

### Thread: [Name the Pattern]

```
project-a ──────────── project-b
    │                       │
    │  [what they share]    │  [what they share]
    │                       │
    └──────── shared concern: [the underlying thread]
```

**Core idea**: _What unifies these projects at a conceptual level?_

<!-- Add more threads as patterns emerge -->

---

## Principle Lattice

> Each principle is an irreducible pattern that manifests across multiple projects at different levels of abstraction. The format is self-similar: one principle, many instantiations.

<!--
Claude: The principle lattice is powerful but takes time to develop. Help users:
1. Notice when they care about the same thing in different contexts
2. Articulate that care as a principle
3. Trace how it manifests across their work

Start with the core principles from CLAUDE.md (sovereignty, correctness, irreducibility) and help them find their own instantiations - or discover new principles entirely.

A principle is ready for the lattice when:
- It recurs across multiple projects/domains
- It's prescriptive (guides decisions, not just describes preferences)
- It can be stated in a single sentence but unpacks into many examples
-->

### ⊕ : Sovereignty

*Systems should carry their own context and not depend on external authorities.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _infrastructural: ..._
- _economic: ..._
- _computational: ..._
- _organizational: ..._

### ≡ : Structural Correctness

*Prefer solutions that are right in structure, not merely ones that work.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _architectural: ..._
- _data modeling: ..._
- _process design: ..._

### Σ→1 : Irreducibility

*Seek the axiom from which the structure unfolds. Compress to the generative minimum.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _documentation: ..._
- _code design: ..._
- _communication: ..._

### 1→7 : Single-Source Multiplicity

*One source, many manifestations. The whole is present in each part.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _configuration: ..._
- _content management: ..._
- _system design: ..._

### [Your Principle] : [Symbol or Name]

*[One-sentence statement]*

**Instantiations**:
- _domain: example_
- _domain: example_

<!--
Claude: Help users discover their own principles. Ask:
- "What do you find yourself insisting on that others might not?"
- "When a project feels 'right', what's usually true about it?"
- "What frustrates you that others seem to accept?"

These often point to implicit principles waiting to be articulated.

## Project Maturity Spectrum

```
Research          Building           Mature             Complete
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[early stage]     [active work]     [production]       [done]
```

<!--
Claude: Help users place their projects on this spectrum. It clarifies where energy should go and what to expect from each project.
-->

---

## Tech Stack Reference

<!--
Claude: If the user works across multiple projects with different stacks, a reference table helps maintain accuracy when discussing implementations.
-->

| Project | Stack | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Maintaining This Map

As projects evolve:
- Add new threads when patterns emerge
- Update maturity positions as work progresses
- Refine principle instantiations when you notice new examples
- Archive completed threads (they're still valuable context)

Tell Claude: *"I just finished X / started Y / noticed Z - let's update the project map."*

The map should always reflect current reality. If it's stale, it's not useful.
