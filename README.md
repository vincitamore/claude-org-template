# Claude-Org: Personal Organization System Template

A collaborative organization system for working with Claude Code. Not just a folder structure - a framework for maintaining continuity across sessions through architecture rather than memory.

## The Core Insight

Claude doesn't remember between sessions. But a well-structured workspace creates an "attractor basin" - terrain shaped by consistent thinking that any Claude instance can orient to immediately.

**This system works because the documentation is collaborative.** Claude helps you discover patterns you might not articulate alone. You help Claude understand what matters. The result is more accurate than either could produce independently.

## What's Included

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) - open Claude Code and start collaborating immediately.

### Full Onboarding (30-60 minutes)
See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) - guided process for discovering your voice and mapping your projects.

## Core Principles

These aren't decoration - they're operational constraints that make the system work:

- **Inversion**: Place the complex at the simple point. The powerful at the humble position.
- **Sovereignty**: You own your data. Everything local, no SaaS dependency.
- **Structural Correctness**: Architecture that prevents invalid states.
- **Irreducibility**: Compress to essential form. Capture insights, not conversations.
- **Single-Source**: One source of truth, many derived views.
- **Visibility**: What matters should be observable. Archive don't delete.
- **Depth Over Broadcast**: The deepest truths are personal, not public.

## The Collaborative Relationship

This system treats Claude as a **collaborative thinker**, not a service provider:

- Claude helps discover and articulate your patterns
- Claude actively maintains system health
- Claude pushes back when something seems wrong
- Claude suggests captures and refinements
- You refine together, not fill in forms

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the collaboration philosophy.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) CLI
- Optional: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with Dataview plugin for visualization

## Customization

The structure is load-bearing; the content is yours to shape:

1. Work with Claude to develop your [context/voice.md](context/voice.md)
2. Map your projects in [context/projects.md](context/projects.md)
3. Add domain-specific knowledge as you work
4. Install and customize hooks from [setup/hooks/](setup/hooks/)
5. Configure agents from [setup/agents/](setup/agents/)
6. Develop your own principles as patterns emerge
