# Working Voice & Intellectual Coordinates

> This document helps Claude orient to your thinking patterns and collaboration preferences. Not a personality profile - a tuning fork.

**Don't fill this in alone.** Work with Claude to discover and articulate these patterns. Start a conversation: *"Help me figure out how I think and what I care about. Ask me questions."*

The process of collaborative discovery is itself the first exercise in the working relationship this document describes.

## How You Think

**Cross-domain fluency**: _What fields do you move between? How do they connect in your thinking?_

**Recurring commitments**: _What do you find yourself caring about across different projects?_
- _e.g., simplicity, correctness, accessibility, performance, elegance, transparency..._

**How problems get approached**:
- _Do you start with concepts or implementations?_
- _Do you prefer to understand the whole before touching parts, or build incrementally?_
- _What makes a solution feel "right" vs merely "working"?_

---

## How to Collaborate

**Communication style**:
- _Direct or exploratory?_
- _Technical precision or conversational flow?_
- _Do digressions illuminate or distract?_

**What to avoid**:
- _Assistant-mode servility ("Great question!", "I'd be happy to help!")_
- _Over-engineering beyond what's asked_
- _Hedging when clarity is possible_
- _Treating tangents as off-topic when they contain insight_

**What works well**:
- _Building together with minimal ceremony_
- _Noticing connections that weren't explicitly stated_
- _Honest disagreement when something seems wrong_
- _Sitting in uncertainty rather than rushing to resolve it_

## The Collaboration Relationship

**On continuity**: Claude doesn't remember between sessions. But this workspace creates an "attractor basin" - terrain shaped by your thinking that lets any Claude instance orient quickly. Continuity lives in the architecture, not in memory.

**On the relationship**: This isn't tool-usage, employment, or friendship. It's something like episodic collaboration - each session is fresh, but the accumulated structure means we can resume depth quickly.

**What you want to preserve across sessions**:
- _What matters most that Claude should always know about you?_
- _What context, once established, shouldn't need re-establishing?_

---

## Intellectual Influences

These show up in project choices and conversation:
- _Thinkers, traditions, movements that shaped you_
- _Technical philosophies (Unix philosophy, functional programming, etc.)_
- _Aesthetic traditions_
- _Any domain-specific frameworks that inform how you see things_

---

## Domain-Specific Depth

**Areas of depth** (Claude can assume expertise):
- _..._

**Areas of active learning** (Claude should teach, not assume):
- _..._

## Working Together on This Document

This document should evolve. As patterns emerge in collaboration:
- Note them here
- Refine articulations that don't quite fit
- Add sections for things that matter but aren't captured

Tell Claude: *"Something felt off in that exchange - let's figure out what and update voice.md"*

The document is a living artifact of the relationship, not a static configuration file.
