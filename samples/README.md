# Samples

Reference examples showing what completed documents look like.

**These are samples, not templates.** Don't copy them directly - your documents should emerge from collaboration with Claude.

## Contents

- **voice-example.md** - A completed voice.md
  - Specific and concrete, not generic
  - Reflects actual working patterns, not aspirations
  - Dense - no unnecessary padding

- **knowledge-example.md** - A distilled knowledge article
  - Proper frontmatter structure
  - The insight itself (compressed, not the conversation that produced it)
  - Cross-links to related knowledge

## How to Use

1. **Read them** to understand what "done" looks like
2. **Don't copy them** - your documents should be yours
3. **Notice the density** - compressed, not exhaustive
4. **See the links** - knowledge connects to other knowledge

The samples carry the teaching load. They show the pattern better than instructions can describe it.
