# Populated Examples

These show what completed documents look like after collaborative discovery and ongoing use.

**These are examples, not templates.** Don't copy them directly - your voice.md should emerge from conversation with Claude, not from copying someone else's preferences.

## Contents

- `voice-example.md` - A completed voice.md after collaborative discovery. Notice:
  - No HTML scaffolding comments remain (they were deleted once content existed)
  - Specific and concrete, not generic
  - Reflects actual working patterns, not aspirations

- `knowledge-example.md` - A distilled knowledge article showing:
  - Proper frontmatter structure
  - The insight itself (compressed, not the conversation that produced it)
  - "When to apply" section
  - Cross-links to related knowledge

## How to Use These

1. **Read them** to understand what "done" looks like
2. **Don't copy them** - your documents should be yours
3. **Notice the density** - these are compressed, not exhaustive
4. **See the links** - knowledge articles connect to each other
