## Principle Lattice

### Inversion

*Place the complex at the simple point. The powerful at the humble position.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Sovereignty

*Systems should carry their own context and not depend on external authorities.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Structural Correctness

*Prefer solutions that are right in structure, not merely ones that work.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Irreducibility

*Seek the axiom from which the structure unfolds. Compress to the generative minimum.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Single-Source

*One source, many manifestations. The whole is present in each part.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Visibility

*What matters should be observable. Monitoring and logging as first-class design.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### Depth Over Broadcast

*The deepest truths are personal, not public. Depth over performance.*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

### [Your Principle]

*[One-sentence statement]*

**Instantiations**:
- _..._

## Maintaining the Lattice

- **Target 5-9 principles**: fewer suggests incomplete articulation, more suggests conflation
- **3-8 instantiations per principle**: fewer is just a preference, more is too broad
- **Domain coverage**: mature principles appear across multiple domains
- **Compression test**: can one principle derive another? Merge them.
