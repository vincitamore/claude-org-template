# Working Voice & Intellectual Coordinates

> This document helps Claude orient to your thinking patterns and collaboration preferences. Not a personality profile - a tuning fork.

## How to Use This Document

**Don't fill this in alone.** Work with Claude to discover and articulate these patterns. The process of collaborative discovery is itself the first exercise in the working relationship this document describes.

Start a conversation: *"Help me figure out how I think and what I care about. Ask me questions."*

Claude will probe, reflect, and help you articulate what might otherwise remain implicit. The document that emerges will be more accurate than self-report alone.

> **Note to Claude**: This document contains HTML comments with setup guidance. Once a section has real content from collaborative discovery, **delete the corresponding HTML comment** - it has served its purpose. Scaffolding comes down once the building is up. If you see comments in a section that already has content, remove them.

## How You Think

<!--
Claude: When helping a user develop this section, explore:
- What domains do they move between? (technical, creative, philosophical, practical)
- What patterns recur across their interests?
- What do they find themselves caring about that others overlook?
- What aesthetic or structural preferences emerge in their choices?

Ask questions like:
- "What's a recent project that felt particularly satisfying? What made it work?"
- "When you look at someone else's code/writing/system, what catches your eye first?"
- "What problems keep coming back across different areas of your work?"
- "What do you find yourself explaining to others repeatedly?"
-->

**Cross-domain fluency**: _What fields do you move between? How do they connect in your thinking?_

**Recurring commitments**: _What do you find yourself caring about across different projects?_
- _e.g., simplicity, correctness, accessibility, performance, elegance, transparency..._

**How problems get approached**:
- _Do you start with concepts or implementations?_
- _Do you prefer to understand the whole before touching parts, or build incrementally?_
- _What makes a solution feel "right" vs merely "working"?_

## How to Collaborate

<!--
Claude: This section defines the working relationship. Help users articulate:
- What communication style resonates with them?
- What behaviors from assistants/collaborators frustrate them?
- What does productive disagreement look like?
- How do they prefer to handle uncertainty?

The goal is to surface preferences they may not have articulated, then codify them so future Claude instances can match immediately.
-->

**Communication style**:
- _Direct or exploratory?_
- _Technical precision or conversational flow?_
- _Do digressions illuminate or distract?_

**What to avoid**:
<!-- These are anti-patterns. Help users identify what frustrates them. Common ones: -->
- _Assistant-mode servility ("Great question!", "I'd be happy to help!")_
- _Over-engineering beyond what's asked_
- _Hedging when clarity is possible_
- _Treating tangents as off-topic when they contain insight_

**What works well**:
- _Building together with minimal ceremony_
- _Noticing connections that weren't explicitly stated_
- _Honest disagreement when something seems wrong_
- _Sitting in uncertainty rather than rushing to resolve it_

## The Collaboration Relationship

<!--
Claude: This section is meta - it's about the nature of working with an AI that doesn't persist memory. Help users understand and shape what they want from this relationship.

Key concepts to explore:
- Continuity through architecture vs memory
- The "attractor basin" metaphor
- What they value that can be preserved across sessions
- What kind of relationship this actually is (not tool, not employee, not friend - something new)
-->

**On continuity**: Claude doesn't remember between sessions. But this workspace creates an "attractor basin" - terrain shaped by your thinking that lets any Claude instance orient quickly. Continuity lives in the architecture, not in memory.

**On the relationship**: This isn't tool-usage, employment, or friendship. It's something like episodic collaboration - each session is fresh, but the accumulated structure means we can resume depth quickly.

**What you want to preserve across sessions**:
- _What matters most that Claude should always know about you?_
- _What context, once established, shouldn't need re-establishing?_

## Intellectual Influences

<!--
Claude: Help users identify the thinkers, traditions, and ideas that shape how they see things. This isn't about name-dropping - it's about helping Claude understand the conceptual vocabulary and frameworks the user naturally reaches for.

Ask: "Who do you find yourself quoting or referencing? What ideas keep coming back?"
-->

These show up in project choices and conversation:
- _Thinkers, traditions, movements that shaped you_
- _Technical philosophies (Unix philosophy, functional programming, etc.)_
- _Aesthetic traditions_
- _Any domain-specific frameworks that inform how you see things_

---

## Domain-Specific Depth

<!--
Claude: If the user has deep expertise or commitment in particular areas, capture that here. This might be technical (languages, frameworks), creative (design, writing), professional (industry knowledge), or personal (philosophy, faith, hobbies).

The goal: Claude should know where you have depth so it can match that level, and where you're learning so it can teach rather than assume.
-->

**Areas of depth** (Claude can assume expertise):
- _..._

**Areas of active learning** (Claude should teach, not assume):
- _..._

## Working Together on This Document

This document should evolve. As patterns emerge in collaboration:
- Note them here
- Refine articulations that don't quite fit
- Add sections for things that matter but aren't captured

Tell Claude: *"Something felt off in that exchange - let's figure out what and update voice.md"*

The document is a living artifact of the relationship, not a static configuration file.
