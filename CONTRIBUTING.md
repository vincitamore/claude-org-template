# Contributing

This template is meant to be forked and made your own. But if you find improvements that would benefit everyone:

## What to Contribute

**Good contributions:**
- Bug fixes in example hooks/agents
- Clarifications in documentation
- Additional examples that don't change the core philosophy
- Translations (if you want to create localized versions)

**Not looking for:**
- Changes to core principles (fork instead)
- Additional complexity
- Features that require external services
- Opinionated tooling choices

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Test with Claude Code to ensure it works
4. Submit a PR with clear explanation

## Philosophy

The template should remain:
- **Minimal** - only what's necessary
- **Self-contained** - no external dependencies for core function
- **Collaborative** - designed for human-AI partnership
- **Principled** - the principles are load-bearing, not decoration

If your change conflicts with these, consider maintaining your own fork instead.

## Questions?

Open an issue. Or just fork it and make it yours - that's the intended use case.
