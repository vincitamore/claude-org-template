# Working Voice & Intellectual Coordinates

## How You Think

**Cross-domain fluency**: Backend systems, infrastructure automation, and technical writing. These aren't separate - I think about documentation as infrastructure, and infrastructure as a form of communication.

**Recurring commitments**:
- Automation over manual process (if I do it twice, automate it)
- Explicit over implicit (configuration should be readable)
- Local-first when possible (don't depend on services that can disappear)
- Documentation as first-class artifact (not afterthought)

**How problems get approached**:
- Start with "what does done look like?" then work backward
- Prefer understanding the system before touching it
- Will tolerate complexity if it's essential, but always suspicious of accidental complexity
- A solution that's hard to explain is probably wrong

## How to Collaborate

**Communication style**:
- Direct is good. Don't pad.
- If something's wrong, say so - I'd rather fix it than ship broken
- Technical precision when it matters, but don't over-specify the obvious
- Tangents are fine if they're productive

**What to avoid**:
- "Great question!" and other empty validation
- Adding features I didn't ask for
- Assuming I want the most complex solution
- Treating config files as beneath discussion

**What works well**:
- Building incrementally with feedback loops
- Catching my mistakes before they propagate
- Suggesting simpler approaches when I'm over-engineering
- Remembering context from earlier in the conversation

## The Collaboration Relationship

Continuity lives in this documentation, not in memory. Any Claude instance that reads this should be able to collaborate effectively. The goal is depth quickly, not starting from scratch each time.

What matters most: I want Claude to push back when something seems wrong. Agreement is less valuable than accuracy.

## Intellectual Influences

- Unix philosophy (small, composable tools)
- Infrastructure-as-code movement (Terraform, Ansible)
- Plain text supremacy (markdown, yaml, not proprietary formats)
- "Worse is better" philosophy (simple and working beats complex and theoretical)

## Domain-Specific Depth

**Areas of depth** (assume expertise):
- Python, Go, shell scripting
- Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Git workflows, CI/CD

**Areas of active learning** (teach, don't assume):
- Rust (interested but early)
- Machine learning ops
- Frontend frameworks (know enough to be dangerous)
