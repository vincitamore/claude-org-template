# Project Topology & Principle Lattice

> Not a flat list but a topology. Projects cluster around conceptual threads that reveal how they relate.

**Build this collaboratively.** As you work on projects with Claude, patterns will emerge - recurring concerns, shared architectures, underlying principles. Start with: *"Let's map my current projects and find the threads that connect them."*

---

## Conceptual Threads

### Thread: [Name the Pattern]

```
project-a ──────────── project-b
    │                       │
    │  [what they share]    │  [what they share]
    │                       │
    └──────── shared concern: [the underlying thread]
```

**Core idea**: _What unifies these projects at a conceptual level?_

---

## Principle Lattice

> Each principle is an irreducible pattern that manifests across multiple projects at different levels of abstraction.

A principle is ready for the lattice when:
- It recurs across multiple projects/domains
- It guides decisions, not just describes preferences
- It can be stated in one sentence but unpacks into many examples

### Inversion

*Place the complex at the simple point. The powerful at the humble position.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _mathematical: ..._
- _linguistic: ..._
- _relational: ..._
- _aesthetic: ..._

### Sovereignty

*Systems should carry their own context and not depend on external authorities.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _infrastructural: ..._
- _economic: ..._
- _computational: ..._
- _organizational: ..._

### Structural Correctness

*Prefer solutions that are right in structure, not merely ones that work.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _architectural: ..._
- _data modeling: ..._
- _process design: ..._

### Irreducibility

*Seek the axiom from which the structure unfolds. Compress to the generative minimum.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _documentation: ..._
- _code design: ..._
- _communication: ..._

### Single-Source

*One source, many manifestations. The whole is present in each part.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _configuration: ..._
- _content management: ..._
- _system design: ..._

### Visibility

*What matters should be observable. Monitoring and logging as first-class design.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _infrastructural: ..._
- _developmental: ..._
- _organizational: ..._

### Depth Over Broadcast

*The deepest truths are personal, not public. Depth over performance.*

**Your instantiations**:
- _epistemological: ..._
- _collaborative: ..._
- _creative: ..._

### [Your Principle]

*[One-sentence statement]*

**Instantiations**:
- _domain: example_
- _domain: example_

## Project Maturity Spectrum

```
Research          Building           Mature             Complete
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[early stage]     [active work]     [production]       [done]
```

## Tech Stack Reference

| Project | Stack | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Maintaining This Map

As projects evolve:
- Add new threads when patterns emerge
- Update maturity positions as work progresses
- Refine principle instantiations when you notice new examples
- Archive completed threads (they're still valuable context)

Tell Claude: *"I just finished X / started Y / noticed Z - let's update the project map."*

The map should always reflect current reality. If it's stale, it's not useful.
